        <h1>National Survey<br><br></h1>
            <div class = "list1">
                    <p>The Vietnam Team HBV, in partnership with the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University, conducted a 
                        survey to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of high school students in Vietnam towards 
                        hepatitis B and liver cancer. A total of 600 high school students from various regions participated 
                        in an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1W2LFwx3a0Ng7nchmlhLbnFXZkacn4CaKmF0PMRPrI9o/edit"target="_blank">online 
                        survey</a> and responded to a structured questionnaire.<br><br>The results indicated that only 
                        63% of the participants had accurate knowledge about the transmission routes of hepatitis B. 
                        Furthermore, less than 20% of the students were aware that hepatitis B affects approximately 10% of the Vietnamese 
                        population, and only about 40% knew that it can cause liver cancer. Additionally, 43% of the students expressed 
                        concerns about sharing food or being in the same classroom with a student who has chronic hepatitis B. The most 
                        preferred channels of education were campus-based educational events and social media campaigns. These findings 
                        underscore the need to educate students about hepatitis B and liver cancer via virtual and in-person outreach 
                        campaigns.
