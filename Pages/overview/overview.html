        <h3>Our Story<br></br></h3>
            <p1>The Vietnam Team HBV was founded by Tien Minh Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant student 
                at Menlo Atherton High School in Menlo Park, California. Tien Minh's passion for social 
                change began in middle school when he started volunteering at Stanford University's 
                Asian Liver Center, the first non-profit organization in the United States addressing 
                the disproportionately high rates of chronic hepatitis B infection and liver cancer 
                in Asians and Asian Americans. It was here that he learned about the devastating impact 
                of hepatitis B and liver cancer on Asian communities, particularly Vietnamese individuals.
                <br> </br> </p1>  
            <p1>With a deepening commitment to this cause, Tien Minh engaged in both community 
                education and research activities at the Asian Liver Center. He was shocked to 
                learn that 1 in 10 Vietnamese individuals live with chronic hepatitis B, a leading 
                cause of liver cancer, and that Vietnam ranked the 5th in liver cancer death in 
                the world. Inspired to make a difference, Tien Minh decided to bring this initiative 
                to Vietnam, his home country. He reached out to his peers in Vietnam and networked 
                with students who shared his passion for making a difference in their community. 
                By December 2022, the Vietnam team HBV had built a network of 9 high school chapters 
                across the country, with 25 core members.
            </p1>
            <p1>Our members are dedicated to learning and using our skills to promote a healthier 
                society. We are proud to join the global JoinJade campaign initiated by Stanford 
                University’s Asian Liver Center in raising awareness about hepatitis B and liver 
                cancer, providing education and resources, and supporting research to help combat 
                these diseases. Thank you for joining us in this important mission.

        <h3>Our Clubs<br></br></h3>
            <p1>Vietnam HBV TEAM Club is a member of the global TEAM HBV network, a multinational network of students participating in the 
                #JOINJADE program initiated by Stanford University with the goal of spreading information, eliminating hepatitis B and liver 
                cancer globally. We are the youth branch of the Stanford University’s Asian Liver Center, the first non-profit in the United 
                States that addresses the high incidence and the dangers of hepatitis B and liver cancer in Asians. Vietnam Team HBV works 
                under the umbrella of the global JOINJADE campaign and in conjunction with the Team HBV High School in the United States, 
                Australia and China for collaboration and ideas exchange.
